The 2017 California wildfire season was the most destructive wildfire season on record.

Early detection of ignition can result in faster response by fire agencies therefore minimizing destruction. In 2017 San Diego, CA residents were invited to watch strategically installed cameras and report fires: "Public can use webcams to watch for wildfires across San Diego County". This is a task that could potentially be automated.

NVIDIA Jetson TX2 is an ideal platform for this kind of applications.
